## Issue Summary

**Duration of Outage:**  
Start: June 7, 2024, 08:30 AM UTC  
End: June 7, 2024, 11:15 AM UTC  

**Impact:**  
During the outage, the K-Corp E-Learning platform experienced a significant slowdown. Users encountered long loading times, with some pages timing out entirely. Approximately 60% of users were affected, leading to disrupted access to educational content and a spike in support tickets.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the Nginx server settings, which led to an excessive number of concurrent connections, overwhelming the server and causing it to slow down.

## Timeline

- **08:30 AM UTC:** Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts indicating high response times and server load.
- **08:35 AM UTC:** Engineers began investigating the alert, initially suspecting a database performance issue.
- **08:50 AM UTC:** Investigation shifted to the application layer, reviewing recent code changes and server logs.
- **09:15 AM UTC:** Misleading path: Assumed a recent update to the user authentication module was causing the slowdown.
- **09:45 AM UTC:** Incident escalated to the DevOps team to examine server and network configurations.
- **10:00 AM UTC:** Nginx configuration identified as a potential issue due to recent changes in connection handling settings.
- **10:30 AM UTC:** Corrected the Nginx settings, reducing the allowed concurrent connections.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** Performance improved; continued monitoring to ensure stability.
- **11:15 AM UTC:** Issue resolved, normal service restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Detailed Explanation of the Issue:**  
The primary issue was traced back to a configuration change in the Nginx server settings made during a recent deployment. The settings were inadvertently set to allow an excessively high number of concurrent connections per worker process. This led to the server being overwhelmed, as it could not efficiently handle the volume of simultaneous requests, resulting in significant slowdowns and timeouts for users.

**Detailed Explanation of the Fix:**  
The resolution involved reverting the Nginx configuration to a more conservative setting for concurrent connections. Specifically, the `worker_connections` parameter was reduced to a level that the server hardware could handle effectively. Additionally, we adjusted the `keepalive_timeout` and `worker_rlimit_nofile` settings to optimize connection handling and file descriptors.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**  
1. **Review Configuration Changes:** Implement a stricter review process for configuration changes, ensuring multiple team members validate the settings.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Add detailed monitoring for Nginx performance metrics, including connection counts and load metrics, to detect similar issues earlier.
3. **Capacity Planning:** Conduct a thorough capacity planning exercise to understand the limits of our current infrastructure and plan for future growth.

**Task List:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Apply the correct settings and patch any identified vulnerabilities.
2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory:** Implement detailed memory usage monitoring to prevent overloads.
3. **Review Deployment Processes:** Update deployment checklists to include configuration validation steps.
4. **Implement Load Testing:** Regularly conduct load testing to understand the system's behavior under different conditions.
5. **Training for Engineers:** Provide additional training on Nginx configuration and best practices for server management.
6. **Documentation Update:** Update internal documentation to reflect the changes made and lessons learned from this incident.

## The Nginx Misconfiguration Dance

To lighten things up, imagine the Nginx server doing a little dance with all the connections trying to join in. Our server was trying to be the life of the party, but it got a bit too crowded on the dance floor! Weâ€™ve now put up some velvet ropes and hired a bouncer to keep things in check.

By taking these steps, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a smoother, more reliable user experience on the K-Corp E-Learning platform.
