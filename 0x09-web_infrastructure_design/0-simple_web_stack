In this diagram, 
the user's computer sends a request to www.foobar.com. The DNS resolves the domain name 
to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). The request is then routed to the web server 
(Nginx), which serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application 
server. The application server processes the request using your code base and interacts 
with the database (MySQL) to retrieve or store data. The application files contain your 
code base, which is responsible for the application's logic and functionality.
