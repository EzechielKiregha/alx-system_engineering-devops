- User's Computer: The user's computer sends a request to access the website or 
application.

- Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy): The request is first received by the load balancer 
cluster, which consists of multiple HAProxy instances working together. The cluster 
distributes the traffic across the Nginx web servers, application servers, and MySQL 
database servers for load balancing and high availability.

- Firewall 1 (Before Nginx): Before reaching the Nginx web server, the traffic passes 
through Firewall 1, which filters and monitors incoming requests to ensure they are 
safe.

- Nginx Web Server: Nginx serves as the web server, handling HTTP requests from users. 
It can also act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the application server.

- Firewall 2 (Before Application Server): The dynamic requests forwarded by Nginx to 
the application server pass through Firewall 2, which provides an additional layer of 
security.

- Application Server: The application server hosts your application code base and 
processes dynamic requests, executing business logic, and interacting with the database.

- Firewall 3 (Before MySQL Database): Any requests from the application server to the 
MySQL database are filtered and monitored by Firewall 3 to protect the database.

- MySQL Database: MySQL is used to store and manage data for the application. It stores 
information such as user data, product listings, and other data necessary for the 
application to function.

- Internal Network: The components are connected via an internal network for 
communication. This network is isolated from external traffic and provides a secure 
environment for the components to interact.
